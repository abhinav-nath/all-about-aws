## Why use a load balancer?

- Spread load across multiple downstream instances
- Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
- Do regular health checks of your instances
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
- Enforce stickiness with cookies
- High availability across zones
- Separate public traffic from private traffic

## Why use an Elastic Load Balancer?

- Distribute traffic across EC2 instances in one or more AZs in a single Region ðŸ“Œ
- ELB is a managed load balancer
  - AWS guarantees that it will be working
  - AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
  - AWS provides only a few configuration options
- Auto scales to handle huge loads
- Load Balancers can be **public** or **private**
- It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end
- It is integrated with many AWS offerings/services like
  - EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon ECS
  - AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
  - Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator

## Health Checks

Health checks enable to route traffic to only healthy instances.

- Health checks are crucial for Load Balancers
- They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards the traffic to are available to respond to requests
- Health Check is done on a port and a route (`/health` is common)
- If the response is not 200 (OK) then the instance is unhealthy

## Types of Load Balancers on AWS

AWS has 4 kinds of managed load balancers:

1. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** : v1 - old generation - 2009
   - supports **Layer 4** protocols (TCP, TLS) and **Layer 7** protocols (HTTP, HTTPS)
   - not recommended anymore by AWS
2. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** : v2 - new generation - 2016
   - most popular and frequently used ELB in AWS
   - supports **Layer 7** protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket)
   - supports all important load balancer features
   - scales automatically based on demand (auto-scaling)
   - can load balance between:
     - EC2 instances
     - containerized applications (Amazon ECS)
     - web applications (using IP addresses)
     - Lambdas (serverless)
3. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** : v2 - new generation - 2017
   - supports **Layer 4** protocols (TCP, TLS and UDP)
   - recommended for very high performance use-cases
4. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)** : 2020
   - operates at **Layer 3** (network layer) - IP protocol
